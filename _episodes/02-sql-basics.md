## SQL Commands

Here are some of the core SQL commands that you'll use in MySQL:

- `CREATE DATABASE`: Create a new database.
- `CREATE TABLE`: Create a new table.
- `INSERT INTO`: Insert new records into a table.
- `SELECT`: Retrieve data from a database.
- `UPDATE`: Modify existing data in a table.
- `DELETE`: Remove data from a table.

## Setting up a client for sql commands

In the terminal , run the following command to start the mysql client inside the Docker container:
~~~bash
docker exec -it myfirst-sqlserver bash -c "mysql -uroot -pmypassword"
~~~
Then you will see mysql command prompt as ``mysql>`` . All the sql command has to be typed in this command prompt.

> # Using a MySQL client in the host
> If you want to use a MySQL client in the host, you can install it (e.g., `mysql-client` package in Ubuntu)
> and connect to the MySQL server running in the Docker container.
> ```bash
> mysql -uroot -pmypassword -P 3306 --protocol=tcp
> ```
> Notice that you need to specify the port number and the protocol to connect to the MySQL server running in the Docker container. See the
> details of the Docker container hosting the MySQL server by running the command `docker ps`:
> ```bash
>  docker ps
> CONTAINER ID   IMAGE     COMMAND                  CREATED         STATUS         PORTS                               NAMES
> f86b66cc36bf   mysql     "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes   0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp, 33060/tcp   myfirst-sqlserver
>```

## Create a database.
We will first create a database named ``metadata`` in our mysql server.
```sql
CREATE DATABASE metadata;
```

To work with a specific database, you can use the USE command. For instance, to select the "metadata" database:
```sql
USE metadata;
```

## Creating a table

In SQL, the CREATE TABLE command is used to define a new table within a database. When creating a table, you specify the structure of the table, including the names of its columns, the data types for each column, and any constraints that ensure data integrity.

Here's a breakdown of the components within the command ``CREATE TABLE <table_name> (<colunmn_name> <data_type> <constraints>)``command:

- ``<table_name>``: This is the name of the table you're creating. It should be meaningful and reflect the type of data the table will store.

- ``<colunmn_name>``: you define the columns of the table.

- ``<data_type>``: This defines the kind of data that a column in your table can hold.      Choosing the right data type is crucial because it determines how the data will be stored and processed. Some example for  commonly used data types are:
    - INT (Integer): This data type is used for whole numbers.
    - VARCHAR(n) (Variable Character): This is used for storing variable-length character strings. The (n) represents the maximum length of the string, ensuring that the stored data does not exceed a specified limit.
    - TEXT: The TEXT data type is used for storing longer text or character data. It's suitable for holding textual content that can vary in length. Unlike VARCHAR, which has a specified maximum length, TEXT allows for storing larger and more flexible text content.

- ``<constraints>``: You can apply constraints to columns. Common constraints include:
    - NOT NULL: This ensures that a value must be provided for the column in every row.
    - UNIQUE: This guarantees that each value in the column is unique across all rows in the table.
    - PRIMARY KEY: Designates a column as the primary key, providing a unique identifier for each row.

By combining these elements, you define the table's structure and ensure data consistency and uniqueness. This structured approach to table creation is fundamental to relational databases and is a key part of database design. Keep in mind a database can have multiple tables.

Now, let's proceed with creating our "dataset" table in "metadata" database.

```sql
CREATE TABLE dataset (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    filename VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    run_number INT NOT NULL,
    total_event INT NOT NULL,
    collision_type TEXT,
    data_type TEXT,
    collision_energy INT NOT NULL
);
```
You can see the table and corresponding columns by using the command
```sql
SHOW COLUMNS FROM dataset;
```
~~~
+------------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| Field            | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
+------------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
| id               | int          | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
| filename         | varchar(255) | NO   | UNI | NULL    |                |
| run_number       | int          | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| total_event      | int          | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
| collision_type   | text         | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| data_type        | text         | YES  |     | NULL    |                |
| collision_energy | int          | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
+------------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+

## INSERT record into table
You can use the INSERT INTO command to add records to a table. This command has structure ``INSERT INTO <table_name> (<column_name>) Values (<column_value>)``.
Here's an example of inserting data into the "dataset" table:
```sql
INSERT INTO dataset (filename, run_number, total_event, collision_type, data_type, collision_energy)
VALUES ("expx.myfile1.root", 100, 1112, "pp", "data", 11275);
```


```sql
INSERT INTO dataset (filename, run_number, total_event, collision_type, data_type, collision_energy)
VALUES ("expx.myfile2.root", 55, 999, "pPb", "mc", 1127);
```

## Search record in the table

The SELECT command allows you to retrieve records from a table. To retrieve all records from the "dataset" table, you can use:
```sql
SELECT * FROM dataset;
```
~~~
mysql> SELECT * FROM dataset;
+----+-------------------+------------+-------------+----------------+-----------+------------------+
| id | filename          | run_number | total_event | collision_type | data_type | collision_energy |
+----+-------------------+------------+-------------+----------------+-----------+------------------+
|  1 | expx.myfile1.root |        100 |        1112 | pp             | data      |            11275 |
|  2 | expx.myfile2.root |         55 |         999 | pPb            | mc        |             1127 |
+----+-------------------+------------+-------------+----------------+-----------+------------------+
~~~
{: .output}
You can select specific columns by listing them after the SELECT statement:
```sql
SELECT filename FROM dataset;
```
~~~
+-------------------+
| filename          |
+-------------------+
| expx.myfile1.root |
| expx.myfile2.root |
+-------------------+
~~~
{: .output}
2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

### Search with some condition
To filter data based on certain conditions, you can use the WHERE clause. This allows you to filter rows based on conditions that you specify. For example, to select filenames where the "collision_type" is 'pp':
```sql
SELECT filename FROM dataset WHERE collision_type='pp';
```
In addition you can use logical operators such as AND and OR to combine multiple conditions in the WHERE statement.
```sql
SELECT filename FROM dataset WHERE run_number > 50 AND collision_type='pp';
```

## UPDATE
The UPDATE command is used to make changes to existing record. For example, if you want to update the "collision_type" and "collision_energy" for a specific record, you can use:

```sql
UPDATE dataset
SET collision_type = 'PbPb', collision_energy = 300
WHERE filename = 'expx.myfile1.root';
```

> ## Update on a condition
>
> update the total_event of file "expx.myfile2.root" to 800.

> > UPDATE dataset
> > SET total_event = 800
> > WHERE filename = 'expx.myfile2.root';

## DELETE
The DELETE command is used to remove record from a table. To delete a record with a specific filename, you can use:
```sql
DELETE FROM dataset
WHERE filename = 'expx.myfile2.root';
```
